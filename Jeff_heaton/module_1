# You can mix strings and variables for printing. This technique is called a formatted or interpolated string. 
# The variables must be inside of the curly braces.

# Be careful that you do not attempt to access an undefined key, as this will result in an error. 
# You can check to see if a key is defined: if "age" in d:
# You can also access the dictionary and provide a default value, as the following code demonstrates.
d.get("unknown_key", "default")
